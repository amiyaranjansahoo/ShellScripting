**The While Loop**

1. The while loop repeats the execution of a code block in the same way that the if statement conditionally executes a code block
2. The syntax for the while loop is as follows:
      while command
      do	   
	        code block
      done
3. The given code block will be repeatedly executed until the given command returns an exit status that is non-zero
